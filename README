Purpose
=======

This package contains an attempt to backport *all* the code from importlib as
found in Python 3.2.  It is provided for people who wish to use sane import
machinery but who are stuck running in Python 2 or who wish to build packages
that are both Python 2 and Python 3 compatible.

For documentation, see the `importlib docs`_ for Python 3.2.
